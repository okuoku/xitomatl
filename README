Derick Eddington's personal collection of various R6RS source-code
------------------------------------------------------------------

Source-code I have created; others' source-code I use and want organized in my
own way; and a whole namespace to do whatever I want with.

I've claimed `(xitomatl ---)' as my personal top-level namespace.  "Xitomatl",
pronounced something like "zye-toe-ma-tul", is the Aztec Nahuatl language word
for tomato.  I chose an obscure word I like and which I doubt anyone will ever
have a conflict with me over :-)

See the test programs in the tests/ folder for examples of how to use my
libraries.

For the latest development version, go to:

  https://code.launchpad.net/~derick-eddington/ikarus-libraries/xitomatl

To use everything in the Xitomatl collection, you'll also need the 
`(xitomatl srfi ---)' SRFIs ports which can be found at:

  https://code.launchpad.net/~ikarus-libraries-team/ikarus-libraries/srfi

My libraries typically require the latest development versions of R6RS
implementations.  Currently supported are: Ikarus, PLT Scheme, and Ypsilon.
They support the *.IMPL.sls convention for implementation-specific libraries.
Larceny might be supported once it supports this convention.

Disclaimer:  
-----------
My libraries are a moving target.  I'm continually changing things.  Other
people's libraries I've assimilated should be stable and should need to be
changed only for bug fixes and updates to new versions.  If in the future some
of my libraries stabilize, I'll advertise that and make documentation.
