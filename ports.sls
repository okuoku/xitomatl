    ;; A compound input port is a custom port which represents the logical
    ;; concatenation of other input ports.  It starts out with an ordered
    ;; collection of input ports and reads from the first one until end of file
    ;; is reached, whereupon it reads from the second one, and so on, until end
    ;; of file is reached on the last of the contained input ports, and then
    ;; subsequent reads from the compound input port will return end of file.
    ;; After each component port is exhausted, it is closed.  Closing a compound
    ;; input port closes all remaining component ports.  get-position and
    ;; set-position! are not supported.
    ;; 
    ;; The first argument to open-compound-input-port must be either a list of
    ;; components or a zero-argument procedure which returns components.  If it
    ;; is a procedure, it is called each time the next component port is needed
    ;; and it must return the next component or #F to indicate there are no
    ;; more.  The second argument must be either a transcoder or #F.  If it is a
    ;; transcoder, the compound input port will be textual and the acceptable
    ;; values for components are textual input ports, binary input ports,
    ;; strings, and bytevectors; otherwise the compound input port will be
    ;; binary and the acceptable values are binary input ports and bytevectors.
    ;; For a textual compound input port, binary input port components are
    ;; transcoded, bytevector components are used as the source of transcoded
    ;; bytevector input ports, textual input ports are used directly and their
    ;; transcoder may be different than the compound input port's, and string
    ;; components are used as the source of string input ports.  For a binary
    ;; compound input port, binary input port components are used directly and
    ;; bytevector components are used as the source of raw bytevector input
    ;; ports.
